### Porter_Delivery_Analysis

I transformed raw dataset information into interactive visual dashboards to uncover key trends and performance metrics. Below is a summary of the work I performed and the tools I utilized:

## What I Did

Market Segmentation Analysis: I categorized apps by their monetization strategy, identifying that a vast majority (approximately 92.61%) are free, while 7.38% are paid.

User Engagement Mapping: I visualized the total number of installs across various categories, highlighting "Game" and "Communication" as the leading sectors with over 30 billion installs each.

Performance Benchmarking: I calculated a global average rating of 3.62 across 33 categories and identified top-performing apps like ROBLOX and Duolingo.

Temporal Trend Tracking: I analyzed the App Update Trend over time, which showed a significant peak in development and maintenance activity around 2018.

Audience Targeting: I segmented the apps by content rating, finding that the "Everyone" category is the primary target audience with over 8.7k apps.

## Tools I Used

Tableau: I used Tableau to build the primary analytical dashboard, leveraging its strength in creating treemaps for category distribution and line charts for temporal trends.

Power BI: I utilized Power BI for interactive reporting, specifically for its slicers and donut charts that allow for easy filtering by content rating and price type.

This project analyzes delivery data to uncover key patterns, performance indicators, and operational factors that affect customer experience and business outcomes. The analysis focuses on delivery times, order values, market behaviors, partner availability, store categories, and customer ordering patterns.

Using Excel-based techniques such as Pivot Tables, statistical functions, correlation, and regression, the study evaluates how delivery protocols, order complexity, partner availability, market characteristics, and customer types influence delivery efficiency and revenue. The insights derived support strategic decisions in staffing, store partnerships, pricing strategies, and customer engagement.

Overall, the project provides actionable insights to enhance delivery efficiency, improve customer satisfaction, boost high-value sales, and guide strategic planning across operations, marketing, and resource management.

The analysis of Porter Delivery’s operational data reveals that delivery performance is influenced by multiple interconnected factors such as market demand, store category efficiency, staffing levels during peak hours, order complexity, and pricing patterns. By leveraging these insights, the company can make data-driven decisions to reduce delivery delays, optimize partner schedules, and target high-value markets and store categories.

Improving delivery performance not only enhances customer satisfaction but also strengthens Porter’s competitive position in the rapidly growing food delivery market. Strategic optimization—such as increasing partner availability during peak times, collaborating with underperforming stores, and targeting high-value order categories—can lead to faster deliveries, higher order values, and increased customer loyalty. Ultimately, this project empowers Porter Delivery to transform operational challenges into profitable opportunities through the power of analytics.
