### Porter_Delivery_Analysis

This project analyzes Porter Delivery’s operational data to uncover key patterns, performance indicators, and operational factors that influence customer experience and business outcomes. The analysis focuses on delivery times, order values, market behavior, partner availability, store categories, and customer ordering patterns to evaluate overall delivery efficiency and revenue performance.Using Excel-based analytical techniques—including Pivot Tables, statistical functions, correlation, and regression analysis—the study examines how delivery protocols, order complexity, staffing levels, market characteristics, and customer segments impact delivery performance. The findings provide valuable insights to support strategic decisions related to staffing optimization, store partnerships, pricing strategies, and customer engagement.The analysis reveals that delivery performance is driven by a combination of interconnected factors such as peak-hour demand, store category efficiency, partner availability, order size and complexity, and pricing patterns. Markets with higher demand require proactive staffing strategies, while underperforming store categories highlight opportunities for operational improvement and collaboration.By leveraging these insights, Porter Delivery can implement targeted actions such as increasing partner availability during peak periods, optimizing delivery schedules, focusing on high-value order categories, and improving coordination with lower-performing stores. Enhancing delivery efficiency not only reduces delays and operational costs but also improves customer satisfaction, strengthens brand loyalty, and reinforces Porter’s competitive position in the fast-growing food delivery market.Overall, this project demonstrates how data-driven decision-making can transform operational challenges into strategic and profitable opportunities, enabling sustainable growth through improved efficiency, customer experience, and resource management.
