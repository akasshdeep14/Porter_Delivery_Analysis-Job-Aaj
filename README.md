### Porter_Delivery_Analysis

This project analyzes delivery data to uncover key patterns, performance indicators, and operational factors that affect customer experience and business outcomes. The analysis focuses on delivery times, order values, market behaviors, partner availability, store categories, and customer ordering patterns.

Using Excel-based techniques such as Pivot Tables, statistical functions, correlation, and regression, the study evaluates how delivery protocols, order complexity, partner availability, market characteristics, and customer types influence delivery efficiency and revenue. The insights derived support strategic decisions in staffing, store partnerships, pricing strategies, and customer engagement.

Overall, the project provides actionable insights to enhance delivery efficiency, improve customer satisfaction, boost high-value sales, and guide strategic planning across operations, marketing, and resource management.

The analysis of Porter Delivery’s operational data reveals that delivery performance is influenced by multiple interconnected factors such as market demand, store category efficiency, staffing levels during peak hours, order complexity, and pricing patterns. By leveraging these insights, the company can make data-driven decisions to reduce delivery delays, optimize partner schedules, and target high-value markets and store categories.

Improving delivery performance not only enhances customer satisfaction but also strengthens Porter’s competitive position in the rapidly growing food delivery market. Strategic optimization—such as increasing partner availability during peak times, collaborating with underperforming stores, and targeting high-value order categories—can lead to faster deliveries, higher order values, and increased customer loyalty. Ultimately, this project empowers Porter Delivery to transform operational challenges into profitable opportunities through the power of analytics.
